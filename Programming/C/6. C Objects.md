# C objects
In C we hace 2 type of 'object', this should not be confused with the OOP object definition, in C an object referers to a type that contains data. This containers **are affected** by **padding** and **alignment**.

## Structures
Structures are the most common used C object this objects represents a set of members, that are called `field`.
Its syntax is :
```c
struct [<optional_struct_name>] {
	type_t var_name; // Cannot inialize or have default values
	// ... more fields
} [<optional_var_name>];
```
**NOTE:**
`<optional_struct_name>` and `optional_var_name` are not exculsive by them but has different meaning if using at the same time.
Example:
```c
struct test_struct {
	int  some_field;
	char naruto;
} var_name;
```
In the given example we see  that `optional_struct_name` and `optional_var_name` but in reality is like we are doing:
```c
struct test_struct {
	int  some_field;
	char naruto;
}; // Declaring the structure type

struct test_struct var_name; // Declaring a variable
```

- if `<optional_struct_name>` is not defined at declaring the type, the struct type would never be instanciable, but it can be useful inside functions or like a unnamed struct member:
```c
void function(...) {
	// dummy code?
	struct {
		int  b;
		char c;
	};
	// Accessible by only
	b = 1;
	c = '\n';
	// Or define a struct like
	struct {
		int d;
		unsigned char boolean_value;
		// Unnamed struct inside another struct
		struct {
			char *fancy_string;
		}
	} local_var;
	// Accessible as 
	local_var.d = 9;
	local_var.boolean_value = 1;
	local_var.fancy_string = "Hello, World!!\n";
	// More code
}
```


## Unions
Well, the things will became strange, this 'container' is equals in instanciation like structure, but has a different behaviour.

The unions only reserve the necesary memory for the largest member size.
Look the next example:
```c
// x86_64 Code
union test_union {
	unsigned char  a;
	unsigned short b;
	unsigned int   c;
	unsigned long  d; // This would be the largest
}; 
// The order of lower/equals member may not something important
// until you use an object(not pointer) inside union
// Due every object has its own order to access to memory.
// on primitive types order isn't important.
```
Asuming that we are executing `64-bit` code, on an `x86_64` architecture processor. 
```c
union test_union test;
printf("size of union: %lu\n", sizeof(test));
test.d = 0x0102030405060708;
printf("value of d= %lu (0x%016lx)\n", test.d, test.d);
// Accessing to a member
test.a = 0x99;
printf("memory value (after a) of test: 0x%016lx\n", test.d);
printf("\ta=0x99, test = %ld\n", test.d);

// Accessing to d member
test.b = 0x7711;
printf("memory value (after b) of test: 0x%016lx\n", test.d);
printf("\tb=0x7711, test=%ld\n", test.d);

// Accessing to c member
test.c = 0x04030201;
printf("memory value (after c) of test: 0x%016lx\n", test.c);
printf("\tc=0x04030201, test= %ld\n", test.d);
```
The result of the execution is :
![Union out](union_access.png)
As you see, the Union is mapping something like this:
`union test_union`
|field name|0x01|0x02|0x03|0x04|0x05|0x06|0x07|0x08|
|:--------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|  
|     d    | ** | ** | ** | ** | ** | ** | ** | ** |
|     c    | xx | xx | xx | xx | ** | ** | ** | ** |
|     b    | xx | xx | xx | xx | xx | xx | ** | ** |
|     a    | xx | xx | xx | xx | xx | xx | xx | ** |
| ---------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
Leyend:
`**`  <- Accessible memory
`xx`  <- Unaccessible memory

This is only a representative table, don't represent what exactly is.
The **order** of the bytes are given by the **Processor** **Endianess**.
