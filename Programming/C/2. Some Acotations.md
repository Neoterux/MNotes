# What is C
C is a programming language developed by bell labs (AT&T), to compile its SO UNIX by a high level language and not use Assembly.

-- And the rest is history nonsense for programming.

## POSIX
A lot C libraries are coded in a serie of rules called POSIX (**P**ortable **O**perative **S**ystem **I**nterface, and the **X** is for Unix), this standard want to define a set of conventions, that determine how a function sould be called o how to structure projects, header files, etc.

## Files used by C 
C principal files are:
- `*.h` are header files in wich functions signatures, global variables, macros, structures, etc. are defined but no implemented.
- `*.c` are c source files, In this files are the unique files that are compiled  and **always** need to have an implementation of a function.
- `Makefile` this file is not inherit for c, but is used in most project, this file contains the rules in which are hardcoded the procedures to compile a library,executable, etc. 

## Preprocessor
C preprocessor is a characteristic of it's compiler, preprocessor can be defined as 'templates' due at compile time are replaced by its content.
The syntax for define a directive is : `#define MACRO_NAME [CONTENT]`
A preprocessor directive can be 'defined' in 3 things:
- As store-true values, macros defines as `#define STORE_TRUE_MACRO`, this macros are used to work with `#ifdef`, `#if <Operation with macro>`, `etc`. Only its definition is used, its value not matter.
- As 'constants', defined as `#define CONST_MACRO <macro-value>`, mostly this is used when a constant value is used in source code, but no have a 'meaning' by itself so save into a variable or make an enum make no-sense, this is because its value is hardcoded in the Machine code instruction, instead to access to some address.
- As 'function directive', defined as `#define macro_function([arg_names, ]) <a lot of code?>`, this is used when a piece of code can be grouped, but no need to define a function, maybe using stack variables?.

### More Preprocessor actions
Preprocessor can be defines as 'another' language so basic but meh, the most known preprocessor directive is `#include <header.h>`, this directive, literally, include the header.h content into the line in which the `#include` is.
Some other are:
- `#include "header.h"` This directive include a local file into the file, no need of env var **INCLUDE_PATH**
- `#include <header.h>` This directive is like the `"header.h"` variant, but the files that uses need to be in `/usr/lib/include`, `/lib/include` that are by default in any compiler, if not in that directory the path sould be passed to toolchain as `-L<Path/to/header/files>` or include path to the env variable **INCLUDE_PATH**.
- `#ifdef <macro>` Check if the  `<macro>` is defined, and execute/replace the content.
- `#ifndef <macro>` Check if the `<macro>` is'n defined, and execute/replace the content.
- `#if <bool>` If the `<bool>` value is true, execute/replace the content.
- `#elif <bool>` the equivalent to `else if <condition>` , do the same as previous macros.
- `#else` Can be appended to `#if...`/ `#elif...`, do the same as previous.
- `#endif` Obligatory macro directive if using an `if` macro, this defines the end of the macro.
- `#undef` contrary operation to `#define` undefine a previous macro.


## Documentation / Manuals
Most gnu/linux install library documentation that could be read by the command `man`

The basic use of `man` is 
`man <v> <libary_name/function_name/etc>`
in which v can be:
- `1` Program section (most software manual, not for developers)
- `2` Syscall section (for low-level libraries)
- `3` Library section
- `4` Device section (not used)
- `5` File format sectoin (not used)
- `6-8` Never used, are Games, Misc, Admin respectively
- `9` Kernel section (for Kernel development, maybe?)
