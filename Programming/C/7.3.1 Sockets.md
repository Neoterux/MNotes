# Sockets
The communication through sockets is a a complex form of communication between  programs.

The communication through sockets require that a client(s) and server implements a ==protocol==%%This need to be reworked or investigate %%.

A socket basically is a kind of 'file', at least in Unix-like systems where a program (server) read the input of every another program connected to it (client).

#### Header files
To work with  sockets we need the same as [[7. IO|IO section]] and some other as:
- `sys/socket.h`
- `sys/netdb.h`
- `arpa/inet.h`  (If working with IPv4/IPv6 addresses)

## Socket Domains
The sockets needs a `domain` to communicate, this `domains` can be translated as the direction in which a program is.
Some used domains are:
- `AF_INET` <- The IPv4 Internet protocol.
- `AF_INET6` <- The IPv6 Internet protocol.
- `AF_UNIX`/`AF_LOCAL` <- For local communication.
- `AF_NETLINK` <- Kernel user interfaces.
- `AF_PACKET` <- Low level packet interface.

you can view more in `man 2 socket`

## Socket Types
This are the communication semantics, that means, how programs are communicated (_"The language"_).
Some used are:
- `SOCK_STREAM` <- provide a sequenced, reliable, two connection based byte stream (TCP).
- `SOCK_DGRAM` <- for datagrams (UDP).
- `SOCK_RAW` <- Provide a raw access to the network protocol.


## Open a socket
A socket is treated as a file, because every socket is a [[7. IO#File descriptors|file descriptor]].
