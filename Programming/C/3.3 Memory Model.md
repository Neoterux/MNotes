# 3.2 Memory Model
So, we are going fast, no?
There is no so much in a raw c without libraries, so we would talk about the memory model of c.

### Brief history
In ancient times C was developed as a wrapper for the assembly, so a compiler in its init literally translate the code to predefined assembly. This lead to write something that is used in assembly, the sections.

### Object Sections 
In a compiled object file, the result code is divided in some sections:
![3.2.1 C Memory Layout](memory_layout.jpg)
- Heap: Is the section of dynamic memory, virtually the SO assign a lot of space to 'fool' programs and say that they has 'enough' memory, this section is allocated in runtime.
- Stack: Is the context of the current execution memory, it contains the code region and store the local variables.
- .bss/bss: This is an ancient section mostly not used, but its reason is to contain the unitialized global/static variables with zero values.
- .data/data: This section contain all the global/static variables that are initialized.
- .text/text: Contains the compiled code from a `*.c` file.
