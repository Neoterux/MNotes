# Pointer Aritmethic

As we show in previous page, a pointer is an integer value, so it can be used to do math.
We would show the previous structue of a pointer:
									`type *ptr = 0x00a0d2d84a25ee7f;`
Now for pointer arithmetich we need to know some things
- `offset` this is a value that would be sum to the pointer, this value can be negative or positive.
- `multiplier` the multiplier is only the size of the type, you can get the size of a type using the macro `sizeof(<type>)`, this would return the size in bytes.

When we add `n` value to a pointer we in reality are adding `n*multiplier` this is called the `offset`.

**NOTE:**
We should not use  pointer arithmetic with **void** pointers due, this could create undefined behaviours into our code.

### Addition
In pointers we can use mutiple operators for addition:
- `+` The unary operator add to the memory address `n-offset` bytes to the original memory address without asigment.
- `-` The unary operator minus to the memory address `n-offset` bytes to the original memory address without assigment.
- `++` and `--` increase and decrease by 1 `offset` , respectively, the pointer, and overwrite the pointer address to `(ptr + 1)`.

Uses:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv){
	int *ptr = 0xaa028afe83ade010;
	// If we use unary operator '+'
	printf("unary plus: %p\n", (ptr + 2)); // This would sum ptr + 2 * sizeof(int)
	printf("ptr value: %p\n", ptr); // The ptr value would remain the same

	// If we use unary operator '-'
	printf("unary minus: %p\n", (ptr-2));// This is equals to do ptr - 2*sizeof(int)
	printf("ptr value: %p\n", ptr); // ptr remains the same

	// If we use post/pre increment the pointer variable
	// would be affect like normal integer/char/long/short 
	// variables
	++ptr; // would sum 1 offset and later return the value
	ptr++; // would return the value and later sum 1 offset
	// ... the same with --
	return 0;
}
