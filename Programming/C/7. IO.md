# IO Operation
Most IO operation can be interpreted as writing/ reading files, but it includes user interaction and program interaction (sockets).

#### Bit Masking
In IO operations bit masking is used a lot for manage the permissions and modes of accessing a file.
- xor (`^`) <- an *xor* operation compare 2 bits and the result is `1` if only 1 bit is `1`, else is 0.
	Ex: 
	1001 ^ 1100 = 0101
- and (`&`) <- an *and* operation compare 2 bits and the result is `1` if both bits are `1`, else is 0.
	Ex:
	0101 & 1110 = 0100
- or (`|`) <- an *or* operation compare 2 bits an the result is `1` if any bit is `1`, if both are `0` then the result is `0`.
	Ex:
	0111 | 0101 = 0111

#### File descriptors
To manage files with system calls, and other things, each executable has multiple `file descriptor` for the opened files, the default file descriptor that every program has are: 
- 0 (`stdin`) the file descriptor for the standard input file.
- 1 (`stdout`) the file descriptor for the standard output file.
- 2 (`stderr`) the file descriptor for the standard error file.

#### File stats
You can view the file stats as its `size`, `last_modification`, or the `best_io_block`  for `read` and `write` operation.
Needed headers:
- `sys/stat.h` <- the base for File stats
- `fcntl.h` <- In this header are the `AT_*` constants (**optional**)
- `errno.h` <- This header is **optional** and is used to show error codes and/or error messages.

`man 2 stat`
