# Requisites for c development
## Global requirements
- install `git`  (optional, for project manager)
- install `make` (for easy compilation)
- install `cmake` (optional, for auto configuration)
- install `pkg-config` (recommended, for library flags facility)
- install `ld`, `ar`, `other toolchain software` (this are installed by the desired toolchain)
- install `valgrind` (recommended/optional, for memory leak detection, require a semi advanced level)

## If using gnu tools
tools needed for gnu:
-  `glibc` (Standar c library for GNU project)
-  `gcc`  (GNU toolchain for c)
-  `gdb`  (GNU debugger, for take out that f*cking bugs)
-  `gef` (GDB-enhanced Features, [repo](https://github.com/hugsy/gef))
notes:
If want to use another libc, you must disable glibc at compile time with `-nostdlib` and append the new libc with `-l<libcname>`

## If using LLVM tools
Tools needed for llvm toolchain:
- `muslibc`, `glibc`, `etc` (LLVM is compatible with any standard C library)
- `clang` (LLVM c toolchain)
- `clangd` (Optional, recommended for syntax highlight )
- `clang-format` (Optional, recommended for code formatting)
- `lldb` (LLVM debugger, has some advantages with gdb but you could use any)
