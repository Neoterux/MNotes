# FHS
**F**ilesystem **H**ierarchy **S**tandard, is a norm that defines the principal directories in a GNU/Linux, and other Unix-Like, operative system.

There is a basic fhs compressed [file](basic-fhs.tar.xz) with anything more than the directory in which the cross-compile tools would be stored temporally.

You can extract them with the command:
`tar -xzf basic-fhs.tar.xz`
